So the GPS and other sensors store their data in a length 30 vector(found in the data folder under OXT). 
This data has a breakdown text file called data format, which details what each element is.

The way I see it, finding the velocity is going to come down to one of two options:

1. Length of the three-dimensional vector of north-east-"up" velocities.
2. Length of the six-dimensional vector of north-east-"up", plus 3 more velocities involving the cars relationship to earth in general.

I don't believe we will need the acceleration data, as the article 
http://www.oxts.com/technical-notes/rt3000-vs-gps-only-speed-comparison/
shows that the velocity is calculated using the acceleration. 


After reviewing as best I could the link Diane provided, I still think that our best approach
is to use the velocity data from the GPS, combined with the vectors from the optical flow
to calculate the velocities of the other cars.
